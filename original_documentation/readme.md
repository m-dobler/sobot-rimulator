### Documentation

Detailed documentation can be found in the [Manual](Manual.txt).

I also wrote about this project for the Toptal Engineering Blog! Read more about the underlying principles of autonomous mobile robotics [here](https://www.toptal.com/robotics/programming-a-robot-an-introductory-tutorial).


### Requirements

*Sobot Rimulator* is cross-platform compatible. In order to run, the following two items must be installed on your computer:
- Python 2.6.1 or higher
- PyGTK 2.7 or higher

To install Python: The latest Python interpreter can be found at http://www.python.org/download/.

Alternatively, both pieces of software should be available through package managers such as Apt-Get (for Linux/Unix) or Homebrew (Recommended for Mac)
